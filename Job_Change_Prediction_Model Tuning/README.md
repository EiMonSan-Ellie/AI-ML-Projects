## Problem Statement

registrations for the training programs of the companies before officially
giving them a permanent role. Among those trainees, the companies want
to know which candidates are really want to work for them or will look
for a new employment after training time. This will help to reduce the
training cost, and bring higher levels of satisfaction and retention. This
work is performed to interpret the main factors impacting to candidate
decision and then build a prediction model to predict the probability of a
candidate will look for a new job or will work for the company using the
current credentials, demographics, experience data, etc.

### What is City Development Index ? 
* The City Development Index was developed for the Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) in 1996 and measures the level of development in cities. The Urban Indicators Programme of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) developed the indicator so that they could rank cities of the world according to their level of development and as a display of indicators depicting development. The CDI cuts across the different clusters identified in the Urban Indicator Framework as it is based on five sub-indices namely, infrastructure, waste, health, education, and city product. It is useful as it provides a snap-shot view of how cities are doing concerning the different indices

## Problem Statement

### Context
Wine is a beverage made from fermented grapes and other fruit juices with a low amount of alcohol content. Wine is the second most popular alcoholic drink in the world after beer, and it is one of the most highly consumed beverages.

Generally, the quality of wine is graded based on the taste of the wine and vintage but this process is time-consuming, costly, and not efficient as the quality of the wine also depends on other physiochemical attributes like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, etc. Also, it is not always possible to ensure wine quality by experts when there is a huge demand for the product as it will increase the cost significantly.

### Objective
Moonshine is a red wine company that produces premium high-quality wines. The company wants to improve its production efficiency and reduce the cost and additional time involved in wine tasting. You as a data scientist at Moonshine company have to build a predictive model that can help to identify the premium quality wines using the available data.

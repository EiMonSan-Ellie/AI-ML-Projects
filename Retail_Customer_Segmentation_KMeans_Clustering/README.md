## Business Context 

Customer segmentation plays an important role in the retail industry by dividing a diverse customer base into smaller, more homogenous groups based on common attributes such as demographics, purchasing behavior, preferences, and more. Based on the information gained from this, retailers can identify customer behavioral patterns and tailor their offerings and marketing efforts to cater to the needs of each segment. This helps retailers improve targeted marketing and optimize inventory management, and consequently increasing sales and customer satisfaction.

### Objective 

In the advent of an expanding customer base, a prominent retail outlet wants to enhance its marketing and service strategies. With rising competition, they understand the importance of getting a better understanding of their customer base to identify customer behavior and needs. This will allow them to move away from broad marketing campaigns and general service approaches to targeted marketing campaigns and customized offerings

To address this, the retailer seeks to implement a more sophisticated ML-based customer segmentation strategy and improve overall customer experience. As a data scientist hired to execute the same, you have been provided historical data on customer demographics and spending patterns. The task is to analyze the data, use ML to segment the customers into distinct groups, and identify the characteristics of each group to help increase marketing efficiency and effectiveness, identify and develop retention strategies for high-value customers, and help the management make informed business strategies on store layouts and pricing.
